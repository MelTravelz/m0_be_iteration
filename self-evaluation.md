# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*I feel much more confident now that I can see how conditionals can fit into the each method....just have to add end for each set of instructions! I think this will be very handy in the future.*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*The practices here were less hand-held and I did consult Google throughout; however, my searching skills will need to improve because I didn't always know how to phrase what I was looking for exactly. In the end the Arrays page on the Ruby Docs proved helpful as well as my classmates in Slack! I was most frustrated when I knew there had to be a conditional typed in somewhere, I did that, but forgot to add an second end. This led to the beginning of some unproductive struggle but I quickly reached out to a classmates and didn't waste too much time I hope.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I still need to practice cloning a new repository from GitHub and connecting a local respository to GitHub...I can do this with my notes in front of me, but without them it would take much longer for me to remember which step goes to which action. I think continued practice each day will help and this evening I'm copying all my notes into a notebook so that extra writing/reading/thinking review should help too!*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I'm not sure I did the reverse order practice correct. The characters in the elements were reverse rather than the entire list. I'll need to post that question and see if others figured it out in my small group...and what they searched for in Google because I just couldn't seem to find the answer.*
